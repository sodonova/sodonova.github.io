## My Personal Website
This is something I've rolled up to showcase some of my work. It's still very much a work in progress, so don't judge too harshly.
The lavendar looking color is ripped off of the Tame Impala Currents album cover. Still awaiting pictures.

Created by editing sass, html, and a very small amount of CSS. Mostly based off of this website template:
